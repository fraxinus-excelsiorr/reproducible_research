# Reproducible Research Assignment
**Candidate number: 1062369**


### Penguins Project

This repository is for my Penguin Project (for question 2 of Reproducible Research assignment). In this project, I aim to investigate whether or not there is a relationship between bill length and depth for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguin species, using the Palmer Penguins dataset. 

## How to reproduce this project 

1. Download PENGUINS_FINAL.Rmd from the penguins folder in this repository to a new folder in your PC (not saved to desktop). 
2. Download the "functions", "figures", and "data" subfolders from the penguins folder in this repository (including their contents), and save them to the folder you just made.
3. Open R and set your working directory to the folder you just made.
4. Ensure that the required R packages are downloaded.
5. Open PENGUINS_FINAL.Rmd in R and run the code.

Note: when my partner ran my code, they accessed the first version of the markdown file rather than the final version. This is also saved in the penguins folder as "assignment_version_1".

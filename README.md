# Reproducible Research Assignment
**Candidate number: 1062369**


### Penguins Project

This repository is for my Penguin Project (for question 2 of Reproducible Research assignment). In this project, I aim to investigate whether or not there is a relationship between bill length and depth for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguin species, using the Palmer Penguins dataset. 

All files and folders needed can be found within the "PenguinProject" folder of this repository. The final, main investigation takes place in the markdown/pdf file "PENGUINS_FINAL". In order to reproduce my analysis, you should download this R markdown file, in addition to the "functions", "data", and "figures" subfolders. When my partner accessed my code, it was the previous version of the markdown file, which is saved in the penguins folder as "assignment_version_1".

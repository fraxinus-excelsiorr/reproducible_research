# Reproducible Research Assignment

### Penguins Project

This repository is for my Penguin Project (for question 2 of Reproducible Research assignment). In this project, I aim to investigate whether or not there is a relationship between bill length and depth for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguin species, using the Palmer Penguins dataset. 

All files and folders needed can be found within the "PenguinProject" folder of this repository. The main investigation takes place in the markdown file "assignment_version_1.Rmd".
